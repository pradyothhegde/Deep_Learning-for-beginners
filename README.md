# Artificial Intelligence
Making the machines smart, just like us (may be smarter than us). This is the overall idea behind AI. It is a process of designing and programming intelligent machines/Intelligent Agents (or the process of humanizing machines) which are capable of predicting and making right decisions. It’s a stage where machines perform the job or action by exhibiting cognitive function surpassing human-level intelligence. AI is not a new concept, in early 1955, a scientist and mathematician from Boston John McCarthy coined the term Artificial Intelligence for the first time, but unfortunately, AI did not find hype at that time. The credit goes to, Mr. Geoffrey Everest Hinton, a cognitive psychologist, computer scientist and Mathematician who gave re-birth to the Artificial Intelligence through Artificial Neural Networks or ANN. His idea of stacking up small computational units called neurons in multiple layers which will learn the abstract representation (or patterns) of unstructured data (images/audio) gave enough strength to make AI into reality.He is also called as father of Deep Learning. Presently he works as a Professor at the University of Toronto, and also for Google AI research.

# What gave AI a magical power!!??
So, what made AI famous!!??, What are all the factors that gave magical powers to AI!!?? What become the fuel for AI engine? Yes, Its Data, Computation power and optimized AI algorithms which played a significant role in making AI into reality, let’s talk about data and computation power.
#### Data
Digitalization and internet generated an enormous amount of data that has ever generated so far, and also the hype of IoT (Internet of things) and sensors all around generated a very huge amount of data which played a significant role in developing and training AI algorithms (Machine Learning /Deep Learning algorithms). Data became the fuel of AI engine because as the data size increased the algorithms performed better.
#### Computation Power
In order to process such a vast amount of data, there should be high- performance hardware’s. CPU’s are unable to process giant data but the modern GPU’s (Graphical Processing unit) and TPU’s (Tensor processing units) made the things simpler, because they are extremely good at processing parallel instructions (Single Instruction Multiple Data).
# What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a technique of developing intelligent models, where the algorithms learn (identifying the patterns) from the data and apply the knowledge gained on new data which the algorithm have never come across to make a right decision or prediction.Example: Consider a machine learning model which is trained on identifying kidney stones. We can make use of this model to detect kidney stones in real time.
### Supervised Learning Method
Supervised learning is the branch of machine learning where the model or algorithm will learn the input and output mapping. These algorithms find the function that maps input to output. Ex: Mapping images with their associated labels. In order to train the model on supervised way, we need to have both input as well as output after the training the model we can test our model on unseen brand new data to test how well our model is doing (accuracy). We can further divide supervised learning into regression problem and classification problem. Some of the major algorithms are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, Nearest neighbour.
### Unsupervised Learning Method
Unlike Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning method does not make use of any labeled or categorized data but instead, it allows algorithms to function on its own without any guidance. Example: Grouping of unsorted data on the basis of similarity, distance and differences. We can further divide the unsupervised learning into clustering problem. Some of the major algorithms to perform clustering are K-means, Hierarchical, Fuzzy C-Means etc.
# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is the branch of machine learning which is highly influenced by behavioral psychology. It’s a technique of finding appropriate action for a given task which maximizes the reward. It’s a kind of trial and error approach, whenever the models perform right it’s rewarded and whenever it performs wrong it’s punished. The algorithm or model learn on its own with the goal of maximizing the reward and minimizing the penalty.
# Deep Learning/Neural Networks/Deep Neural Networks/Artificial Neural Network
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is greatly inspired by the working of the human brain. Deep learning models include stacks of neurons (small computational units) arranged in multiple layers which are capable of extracting high-level features or patterns from the input data. Initial layers focus on extracting simple features from the data as the model goes down more number of neurons are stacked up to extract more complex features. Deep learning models use special type of algorithm known as backpropagation (Backpropagation is a supervised method of computing gradients by recursive application of chain rule). One of the important features of deep learning models are; model accuracy or model performance increases as the size of the data increases. Deep learning models produced astonishing results in classifying unstructured data like images and audios. Some of the major algorithms under deep learning models are Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs), General Adversarial Network (GANs).
