# Artificial Intelligence
Making the machines smart, just like us (may be smarter than us). This is the overall idea behind AI. It is a process of designing and programming intelligent machines/Intelligent Agents (or the process of humanizing machines) which are capable of predicting and making right decisions. Itâ€™s a stage where machines perform the job or action by exhibiting cognitive function surpassing human-level intelligence. AI is not a new concept, in early 1955, a scientist and mathematician from Boston John McCarthy coined the term Artificial Intelligence for the first time, but unfortunately, AI did not find hype at that time. The credit goes to, Mr. Geoffrey Everest Hinton, a cognitive psychologist, computer scientist and Mathematician who gave re-birth to the Artificial Intelligence through Artificial Neural Networks or ANN. His idea of stacking up small computational units called neurons in multiple layers which will learn the abstract representation (or patterns) of unstructured data (images/audio) gave enough strength to make AI into reality.He is also called as father of Deep Learning. Presently he works as a Professor at the University of Toronto, and also for Google AI research.
